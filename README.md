# genetic-algorithm-optimization

A simple program for function optimization through approximation. I this case, this operation is implemented through the use of a genetic algorithm. In its current state, the program works for 2 independent variable functions. Three test functions have been written inside the code, the rastrigin, ackley and sphere ones
